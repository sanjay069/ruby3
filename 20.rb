  # There is an ATM machine. Initially, it contains a total of 
# K units of money. N people (numbered 1 through N) want to withdraw money; for each valid i, 
# the i-th person wants to withdraw A i â€‹ units of money.
# The people come in and try to withdraw money one by one, in the increasing order of their indices. 
# Whenever someone tries to withdraw money, if the machine has at least the required amount of money,
#  it will give out the required amount. Otherwise, it will throw an error and not give out anything;
#   in that case, this person will return home directly without trying to do anything else.
# For each person, determine whether they will get the required amount of money or not.
