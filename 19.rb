# Alice and Bob were having an argument about which of them is taller than the other. 
# Charlie got irritated by the argument, and decided to settle the matter once and for all.
# Charlie measured the heights of Alice and Bob, and got to know that Alice's height is 
# X centimeters and Bob's height is 
# Y centimeters. Help Charlie decide who is taller.
# It is guaranteed that X ≠ Y.
